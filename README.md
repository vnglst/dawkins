# Description
A Single Page App (written in Javascript) based on the computer program described in the book “The Blind Watchmaker” by Richard Dawkins. Dawkins uses this program to illustrate the principle of natural selection: by picking one of the four trees (fractals) shown the user is able to simulate evolution artificially. Based on the user’s selection the application generates three new siblings. These are based on the original fractal, but with one of the genes ‘mutated’ (changed). The siblings will therefore look slightly different. If the user repeatedly picks variants with a certain characteristic this feature will become more dominant.

## Technology used
The program uses jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap and it’s one of the first programs I wrote in Javascript.
